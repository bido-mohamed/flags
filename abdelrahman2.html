    The national flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Jack, also known as the Union Flag.[a]

    The design of the Union Jack dates back to the Act of Union 1801, which united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the
    Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The
    flag consists of the red cross of Saint George (patron saint of England, which also represents Wales), edged in
    white, superimposed on the saltire of Saint Patrick (patron saint of Ireland), also edged in white, which are
    superimposed on the saltire of Saint Andrew (patron saint of Scotland). Wales is not represented in the Union Flag
    by Wales's patron saint, Saint David, because the flag was designed whilst Wales was part of the Kingdom of England.

    The flag proportions on land and the war flag used by the British Army have the proportions 3:5.[10] The flag's
    height-to-length proportions at sea are 1:2.[11] The Union Flag also features in the canton of the flags of the
    Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, and the British Merchant Navy. These flags are known as ensigns.

    The earlier flag of Great Britain was established in 1606 by a proclamation of King James VI and I of Scotland and
    England.[12] The new flag of the United Kingdom was officially created by an Order in Council of 1801, with its
    blazon reading as follows:

    The Union Flag shall be azure, the Crosses saltire of Saint Andrew and Saint Patrick quarterly per saltire,
    counter-changed, argent and gules, the latter fimbriated of the second, surmounted by the Cross of Saint George of
    the third fimbriated as the saltire.[13]

    No official standardised colours were specified, although the Flag Institute defines the red and royal blue colours
    as Pantone 186 C (RGB 207, 20, 43) and Pantone 280 C (RGB 0, 36, 125), respectively

The Italian Flag Day named Tricolour Day was established by law n. 671 of 31 December 1996, and is held every year on 7
January. This celebration commemorates the first official adoption of the tricolour as a national flag by a sovereign
Italian state, the Cispadane Republic, a Napoleonic sister republic of Revolutionary France, which took place in Reggio
Emilia on 7 January 1797, on the basis of the events following the French Revolution (1789â€“1799) which, among its
ideals, advocated national self-determination. The Italian national colours appeared for the first time in Genoa on a
tricolour cockade on 21 August 1789, anticipating by seven years the first green, white and red Italian military war
flag, which was adopted by the Lombard Legion in Milan on 11 October 1796.

After 7 January 1797, popular support for the Italian flag grew steadily, until it became one of the most important
symbols of Italian unification, which culminated on 17 March 1861 with the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, of
which the tricolour became the national flag. Following its adoption, the tricolour became one of the most recognisable
and defining features of united Italian statehood in the following two centuries of the history of Italy.

    this article is about the flag of the People's Republic of China since its creation in 1949. For the flag of the
    Republic of China, commonly known as the flag of Taiwan, see Flag of the Republic of China. For other uses, see Flag
    of China (disambiguation).
    The national flag of the People's Republic of China, also known as the Five-star Red Flag,[1] is a Chinese red field
    with five golden stars charged at the canton. The design features one large star, with four smaller stars in an arc
    set off towards the fly. It has been the national flag of China since the foundation of the People's Republic of
    China on 1 October 1949. The flag was designed by Zeng Liansong.
    The red represents the Chinese Communist Revolution. The five stars and their relationships to each other represent
    the unity of four social classes of Chinese people, symbolized by four smaller stars, under the Chinese Communist
    Party (CCP), symbolized by the large star. The flag was first hoisted by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) on a
    pole overlooking Beijing's Tiananmen Square on 1 October 1949, at a ceremony proclaiming the establishment of the
    People's Republic of China.
